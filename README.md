# Color-Image-Enhancement
Color images are often obtained under undesirable weather and brightness conditions. Low brightness, poor contrast, poor color quality and sudden changes in light occur in images taken under poor or uneven light. To enhance color images, it is necessary to maintain the color information and mean brightness while contrast is increasing. The enhancement process obtained by applying the heat conduction equation of solid and stagnant fluids on color images is carried out.
